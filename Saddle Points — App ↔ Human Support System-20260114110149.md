# Saddle Points — App ↔ Human Support System

**Saddle points** are the few places where the entire system can fail or scale, regardless of how good the app or team is.
If these are designed right → system compounds
#### If not → humans become a permanent crutch
## Purpose
Identify the **few critical points** that decide whether the App-led + Human-support model scales or collapses.
## Saddle Point 1: User ↔ Support Connection System
_(Incidence System – Pre-Order & Post-Order)_
### What must exist
*   One system connecting **app, chat, call, WhatsApp**
*   Every interaction logged as an **Incidence**
*   Incidence linked to:
    *   User
    *   Order (if exists)
    *   App screen / state
### Why it matters
*   Support sees full context
*   User doesn’t repeat themselves
*   All interactions are traceable
### If this fails
*   Blind support
*   Repeated questions
*   No learning from users
## Saddle Point 2: CX Team Training & Escalation Rules
### What CX must know
*   Every app screen and flow
*   What users see at each step
*   What can and cannot be promised
### CX is allowed to
*   Clarify
*   Reassure
*   Compare options
*   Help complete the order
### CX is NOT allowed to
*   Push or sell
*   Restart the journey
*   Override app logic
*   Make off-system promises
### Escalate only when
*   High-value order
*   System bug
*   Policy exception
*   Emotional or critical situation
### If this fails
*   Sales-like behavior returns
*   Inconsistent customer experience
*   Trust erosion
## Saddle Point 3: Incidence Information Architecture
### Support must instantly see
*   User details & language
*   Order context (if any)
*   Current app screen
*   Items selected / attempted
*   Reason for incidence
*   Previous interactions
### Every incidence must capture
*   Issue category
*   Root cause
*   Resolution
*   Order outcome
### If this fails
*   Guess-based support
*   No data for product improvement
*   Poor investor visibility
## Saddle Point 4: Friction Detection Logic
### System should detect
*   Long inactivity
*   Repeated back-and-forth
*   Quantity confusion
*   Payment retries
### Why it matters
*   Human help appears **only when needed**
*   Reduces random support usage
### If this fails
*   Too much or too little human involvement
*   Cost increases silently
## Saddle Point 5: Cost & Control of Human Help
### Must be defined
*   When human help is allowed
*   Channel allowed (chat / call)
*   Time limits per incidence
### Example (indicative)
*   Low value → no human
*   Medium value → chat only
*   High value → call allowed
### If this fails
*   Human cost explodes
*   Margins erode
*   Investors lose confidence
## Saddle Point 6: Product Feedback Ownership
### Must exist
*   Weekly review of top incidence reasons
*   Clear owner for fixes
*   Incidence → product change loop
### If this fails
*   Same issues repeat
*   Humans become permanent crutches
## Final Principle
*   App drives the journey
*   Humans remove friction
*   Data improves the product
*   Human dependency reduces over time
**If any saddle point breaks → system breaks.**
